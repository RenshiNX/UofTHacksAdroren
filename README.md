Our project involves a user inputing personal information that will generate a vulnerability score. Using COVID statistics in one's area and their vulnerability
score, we will calculate a risk score, suggesting if they should go out, hotspot areas to avoid and a reminder to follow COVID precautions (social distancing,
wearing a mask, using hand sanatizer, etc.)

This project was created by Rishi Nair and Aditya Pisharoty. We are grade 11 students from the University of Toronto Schools.
